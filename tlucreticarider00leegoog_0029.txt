of meaningless ceremonial, and in the age of Lucretius
it had lost all hold upon the higher classes of Roman
society: as a moral principle it was absolutely desti·
tute of value or significance. The religion of Greece
on the other hand was in itself pleasing and beautiful,

world. They profess to believe in the existence of
Gods, but as beings who by the very condition of
their existence stand apart from the world and the

to force upon them both this denial of divine pro
vidence, just as Lucan¹ refused to believe that the Gods
could care forman, since they had allowed the liberty
of Rome to be destroyed on the field of Pharsalia, and
Olaudian¹ felt tempted to be an atheist, when, like
the Psalmist, he ‘saw the ungodly in great pros-

· perity’.
