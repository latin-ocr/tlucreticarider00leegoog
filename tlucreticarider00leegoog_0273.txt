'l'he passage is interesting as hearing on the question how the
Romans dispoeed ol their dead, lor which see the Appendix to
Beeker’s ‘Gallus’ on ‘the Interment of the dead’. “The oua·
tom of burying is said to have been older than that oi turning,
and there were eertain families whioh adhered to it down to a
late period-but burning the eorpse oame very early into use.
A sepultura always took place, even when the body had been
burnt....coffins were mostly oi wood, but also at times of more
eostly materials; still the sarcophagi, as they are called-so
named from the remarkable properties of the lupis sarcophaga,
though also oonstmeted oi marble and other stone—must be
oonsidered only as the outer receptaele of the ooffin.” Xeno
{hon (Hellen. v. 3. 19) tells us that Agesilaus was embalmed in

906-908. ‘But for us, as we stood by (prope), and saw
thee turn to ashes on the horrible pyro, we wept and oould net
weep our fill, and our undying grief no time, no! Laehm
would translate ‘almost the colons ol ashes, in the tomh’. He
argues at great length that this must be the meaning of eine·
