rra subject of tle poem ‘Dc Rerum Natura)

The poem of Lucretius is remarkable and almost·
unique as an attempt to expound in verse a com·
plete system of philosophy-that of Epicurus. This
system embracesboth Ethics-the science oi human
action, and Physica—the science of nature Both
sides are sel forth by Lucretius, but with this differ-
enoe, that the physical theory occupies the main body
of the poem, while the ethical teaching is given
chiefly in digressions and parentheses, these being
usually, as might be expected, the passages in which
,che highest level oi poetry is reached. Before at·
tempting to discuss the philosophy of Lucretius it
will be convenientia give e shore analysis of the

Ι whole poem.

In Book I., after an invocation of Venus and a
prayer for peace, with a dedication of the poem to
' Memmius and a eulogyol Epicurus, he declares his
intention to explain the Nazarra aad Oripa'a os thinqe,
with a special purpose, namely ao deliver men from
the Boadcpe qs Relipioa (illustrated by tho story of
Iphigeneia).
