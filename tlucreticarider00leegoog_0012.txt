PREFACE

So far as Ι know, this is the first attempt that
has been mado to edit s‘populor’ edition of any
port of Lueretius. Iam well owsre of the diffi-
oulty of the task und olso of the reasons why
the author has hitherto been little read at schools.
But, considering his grestness as a poet, os well
us the fact that a knowledge ol Lucretius is
absolutely indispensable to a right understanding
of Vergil, I think that this is to be regretted.

For the benefit of those who merely wish to
acquaint themselves or their pupils with the style
and manner of Lucretius without adventuring
for on his philosophy, I hove given a list of
selections, amounting to about 1100 lines snd em-
brsoing without doubt some of the finest poetry
which oon be found in any language. Almost
all ol these passages Ι have myself read with
a Sixth Form, snd the subjeot'oertuinly seemed
to be popular· and called forth considerable in·
