⁴ [This is the protest of Epicurus and Lueretius against the
1121111111 (sort foedera) ol Demooritus and most of the Stoica.
The theory is interesting and original, and it is stated by Luer.
with muoh earnestness. The great controversy ο1 froewill sud
necessity has been debated fiereely both in anoient and modern
times, and we are bound to sympathise with any affort to
emsnoipate the human will from the dominion of inexorable
ἀνάγκη. 12 11 soaroely neoessary 2ο say 21112 the theory is un·
satisfaetory, but the defeat lies mainly in the impossibility of
aooounting for the operatione ot the mind on any purely mata-
rialistie hypothesis.

The argument appears to be ss lollows: Freewill appears in
human aetion (1) in initiating movement; (2) in resisting oom-
pulsion. spplying this to the atoms, he eompares the foros to
be overoome (1) in the first ease (261 foll.) to the motion rard
στάθμην (by weight), the downward motion in perpendiculsr
lines-«the dull dated oourse oi events ; (2) 111 the seoondoase (222
1111.) to the motion of storns κατὰ πληγὴν (alter collision with
one another), the πληγαὶ ,1111111οωί18 to the oompelling loros.
In this statement he seems to leave out oi sight what he stated
albore, that the eollision oi atoms would be impossible without
t e ‘swerve ’.

In 288 to 293111 states that the atoms are enabled to resist
plopua partly on aooount of their weight, but in the minutus
power oi resistanoe is given by the ‘swerve' alone. Here the
argument is not very clear, and the parallelism oi mind and
atoms appears to breslr down]
