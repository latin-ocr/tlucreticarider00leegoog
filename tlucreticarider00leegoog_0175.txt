by Lucilius (op. ιιι. 1032 and note).

(isius Memmius, to whom Lucretius here dedicates his
poem, was praetor iu the year 58. Διιιιοι time he belonged
ιο the senatcnial party, and his wife was the daughter of Sulla
but before standing for the consulship ln 54, he made his
peeoe with the democrats, and was supported by (loeson sur
afterwards offending him he was impeached lor ambitus, aud
withdraw to Mytilene. The antiqnity of the family of ihs
Memmii is slluded ιο by Vergil (Δ. v. 117), and the fact that
Lucretius addresses Memmius on terme of equality, goes ιο
prove that the post himself was of high lineage. He has here
followed the example of Epicurus, who addressed his work ιο
the ‘son ol Anohytus’. But Memmius, ιιι the poem oi huone
tius, merely represents ths philosophical enquirer in general.
Personally he was probably very far removed from being ibe
ideal student of Epicureanism, if we are ιο believe the bitter
words oi Catullus, who had followed him ιο Bithynia, and

“ seems to have been disappointed in his hopes of gain (see
Gatull x. and xxviii).

, Ιι appears also from a letter of Cicero’s, addreassd ιο him,
(sd lam. xiii. 1) that, having become possessed of the gruum
on which stood the ruins of the house of Epicurus, he proposed
at first ιο pull them down in order ιο build a house for himself,
and afterwards refused to give up the site ιο the then head cf
the Epicurean school.

Lines iil-52, aba, 332 end other passages, seem ιο indioate
that Lucretius had little confidencs in his aeal ior philosophy,
although here and ιιι lines 42 and 140 he speaks of himin

terum of high prsise.
