ΜΝ] OF eudemus xv

For any further informationes a personal nature
about Lucretius we must go to his poem, all the arsil-
able hints in which are most ingeniously worked out
by Prot. Sellar. From it we gether that he was a
man of a most earnest and enthusiastic temper¹,
with a profound admiration for the great men of the
past¹5 gisted with remarkable powers of observation
and a keen appreciation oi the beauties of nature,
especially in her remoter and less frequented soenes

·as well as in her grandeur and immensity. His
similes are taken from fields and woods and moun·
taine, from sailing, riding, hunting. He had travelled
and seen ‘ the pomp and pageantry of great armies⁸'.
Again, although ‘non-intervention’ in politics was
the creed ol his philosophy, it would seem that he
had witnessed from near at hand and grieved over
—perhaps suffered in—the disorders oi the dreadful
days in which he lived⁴. Finally, there are various

passages which indicate that he had had consider·
able experience of the ways of women, and the con·¹
elusione he draws are by no means favourable to the
sex³.
