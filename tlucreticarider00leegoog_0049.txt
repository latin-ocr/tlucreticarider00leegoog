xlii . MANUSORIRTS AND

Lachmann. 1850.
⁴ Bernays (Teubner Text). 1852.
Munro. 1860.

The three last editions only have been employed
in forming the present Text. I have t'cr the most
part followed Munro, but he seems occasionally to
carry the licenee cf transposition to an extreme point
It is certain that many lines and passages have been
misplaced-generally, nc doubt, from having been
omitted by a transcriber and 'then written in at
another place. But, as there a're many signs that
the Text oi Lucretius lacked the final revision⁴ of its
author, we ought not to expect to find rigid aecuraey

and consistency throughout, and I have preferred to
keep the order of the MSS. wherever it will yield

a 801186.
