Resides this. Lucretius no doubt wished ιο give somethlug
οι the character οι a nationcl epieto his poem, by commeneing
withan allusion tc the mythical story ol the divine origin οι
the Romans—the ‘sons of Aeneas'. Munro notices tur-ther
that Mars was the god of Plenty in the old Italian mythology:
that a figure cf Venus appears on the coins cl Memmius, ιο
whom the poem ol Lucretius is addressed. and that Empedocles
(whom Lucretius largely follows) made ‘Leve’ and ‘Striie' the
two ruling principles of the uniteroe.

Some suppose that the petitiou for peaes is intended ιο be
addressed to the uewly wedded pair, Julia and Pompey‚ who-
as was often the csse afterwards in addresees to emperors and
their consorte-are represented aa Venus and Mars.

551); and passively oi mune (daedala almedis carmine ii. 505)
