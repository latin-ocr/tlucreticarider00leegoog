be quoted from Oicero which very closely resemble
Lucretius¹. Some suppose that the editor alluded
to by Jerome is Quintus Cicero, but this is im-
probable.

Other passages in which Lucretius is mentioned by
name are the following :-

0111, Am. 1 15, aa

Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti
Eaitio terras cunt dabit una dies.

Statius silv. ii. 7, 76

Docti juror arduus Lucreti.

Quintilian describes him as ‘an elegant writer on
his own subject, but difficult'. Tacitus speaks of
critics who preferred him to Vergil. Horace-who
was an Epicurean oi a very different type-no doubt

’ alludes to him in S. 'a v. lOl-deos didici secarunt
ι apere assona—as probably does Vergil in the famous

passage inwhich he describes the physical philosopher
(Georg. ii tto-492)

Felia qui patuit causas copnascere reram
Atque metas omnes et inexorabile saturn
Subjeeit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis aean.

1Martha (Appendix‚ p. 351) quotes several very close
parallels between (lio. de Fin. i. 14-28 and 31, and various

lines in Lacr. Alsc a remarkable allusion in Tusa. 1. 21:
Soleo saepe mirari nonnullorum insolentiam philosophorum,
qai naturae capnitionem admirantur, ejusque inventori et prin-
cipi pretias resultantes appensumque venerantur ut deurn:
liberatos enimse per enm dicunt pravissimis domins, terrore
sempiterno. Op, Lucr. 1. 62-79, 111 9-15 (divina nume
comta), tots-1044.
